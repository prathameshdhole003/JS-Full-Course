// HTML events are "things" that happen to HTML elements.
// When JavaScript is used in HTML pages, JavaScript can "react" on these events.

// An HTML event can be something the browser does, or something a user does.
// Here are some examples of HTML events:

// An HTML web page has finished loading
// An HTML input field was changed
// An HTML button was clicked
// Often, when events happen, you may want to do something.

// JavaScript lets you execute code when events are detected.
// HTML allows event handler attributes, with JavaScript code, to be added to HTML elements.

// Four ways of writing JavaScript events
// 1. Using inline events alert()
// 2. By calling a function
// 3. Using Inline events (HTML onclick="" property and event.onclick)
// 4. Using Event Listeners (addEventListener and IE's attachEvent)
