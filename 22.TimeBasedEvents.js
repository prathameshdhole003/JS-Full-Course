// Timing Based Events in JavaScript
// The window object allows execution of code at specified time intervals
// These time intervals are called timing events

// Methods
// 1. setTimeout(function, milliseconds) -> Executes a function after waiting for specified number of milliseconds
// 2. setInterval(function, milliseconds) -> Same as setTimeOut() but, repeats the execution of function continuously
